ARPQuerier(IP, ETH, I<keywords>)
ARPQuerier(NAME, I<keywords>)

=s arp

encapsulates IP packets in Ethernet headers found via ARP

=d

Handles most of the ARP protocol. Argument IP should be
this host's IP address, and ETH should be this host's
Ethernet address. (In
the one-argument form, NAME should be shorthand for
both an IP and an Ethernet address; see AddressInfo(n).)

Packets arriving on input 0 should be IP packets, and must have their
destination address annotations set.
If an Ethernet address is already known
for the destination, the IP packet is wrapped in an Ethernet
header and sent to output 0. Otherwise the IP packet is saved and
an ARP query is sent instead. If an ARP response arrives
on input 1 for an IP address that we need, the mapping is
recorded and any saved IP packets are sent.

The ARP reply packets on input 1 should include the Ethernet header.

ARPQuerier may have one or two outputs. If it has two, then ARP queries
are sent to the second output.

ARPQuerier implements special behavior for 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, multicast
addresses, and, if specified, any BROADCAST address.  Packets addressed to
0.0.0.0 are dropped.  Packets for broadcast addresses are forwarded with
destination Ethernet address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.  Multicast IP addresses are
forwarded to 01-00-5E-xx-yy-zz, where xx-yy-zz are the lower 23 bits of the
multicast IP address, as specified in RFC1112.

Keyword arguments are:

=over 8

=item TABLE

Element.  Names an ARPTable element that holds this element's corresponding
ARP state.  By default ARPQuerier creates its own internal ARPTable and uses
that.  If TABLE is specified, CAPACITY, ENTRY_CAPACITY, and TIMEOUT are
ignored.

=item CAPACITY

Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved IP packets the table will
hold at a time.  Default is 2048.

=item ENTRY_CAPACITY

Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of ARP entries the table will hold
at a time.  Default is 0, which means unlimited.

=item TIMEOUT

Time in seconds.  Amount of time before an ARP entry expires.  Defaults to
1 minute.

=item BROADCAST

IP address.  Local broadcast IP address.  Packets sent to this address will be
forwarded to Ethernet address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.  Defaults to the local
broadcast address that can be extracted from the IP address's corresponding
prefix, if any.

=back

=e

   c :: Classifier(12/0806 20/0002, 12/0800, ...);
   a :: ARPQuerier(18.26.4.24, 00:00:C0:AE:67:EF);
   c[0] -> a[1];
   c[1] -> ... -> a[0];
   a[0] -> ... -> ToDevice(eth0);

=n

If a host has multiple interfaces, it will need multiple
instances of ARPQuerier.

ARPQuerier uses packets' destination IP address annotations, and can destroy
their next packet annotations.

ARPQuerier will send at most 10 queries a second for any IP address.

=h ipaddr read/write

Returns or sets the ARPQuerier's source IP address.

=h broadcast read-only

Returns the ARPQuerier's IP broadcast address.

=h table read-only

Returns a textual representation of the ARP table.  See ARPTable's table
handler.

=h stats read-only

Returns textual statistics (queries and drops).

=h queries read-only

Returns the number of queries sent.

=h responses read-only

Returns the number of responses received.

=h drops read-only

Returns the number of packets dropped.

=h insert w

Add an entry to the ARP table.  The input string should have the form "IP ETH".

=h delete w

Delete an entry from the ARP table.  The input string should be an IP address.

=h clear w

Clear the ARP table.
