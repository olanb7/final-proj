RED(MIN_THRESH, MAX_THRESH, MAX_P [, I<KEYWORDS>])

=s aqm

drops packets according to P<RED>

=d

Implements the Random Early Detection packet dropping
algorithm.

A RED element is associated with one or more Storage elements (usually
Queues). It maintains a running average of the sum of the queue lengths, and
marks packets with a probability proportional to that sum. By default, the
Queues are found with flow-based router context. If the RED is a push element,
it uses the nearest downstream Queues; if it is a pull element, it uses the
nearest upstream Queues.

Marked packets are dropped, or emitted on output 1 if RED has two output
ports.

Keyword arguments are:

=over 8

=item QUEUES

This argument is a space-separated list of Storage element names. RED will use
those elements' queue lengths, rather than any elements found via flow-based
router context.

=item STABILITY

Unsigned. This number determines how stable the average queue size is -- that
is, how quickly it changes due to fluctuations in the instantaneous queue
size. Higher numbers mean more stability. The corresponding conventional RED
parameter is w_q; STABILITY equals -log_2(w_q).

STABILITY should equal

   -log_2 (1 - e^(-1/K)),

where K is the link bandwidth in packets per second. Default STABILITY is 4.
This is very low (unstable) for most purposes; it corresponds to a link
bandwidth of roughly 15 packets per second, or a w_q of 0.25. The NS default
setting for w_q is 0.002, corresponding to a STABILITY of roughly 9.

=back

The RED element implements the Gentle P<RED> variant first proposed by Sally
Floyd in October 1997.
